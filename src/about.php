            <p>Independent thinker seeking innovative solutions to complex problems.</p>
            <p>Working as a professional musician for more than ten years taught me that the most valuable things in life can only be achieved through dedication, and it is in the same spirit that I approach my work as a designer today. I love to be surrounded by smart, yet humble people, and I will do everything I can to help them leverage their strengths in an effort to materialize a vision.</p>
            <p>I have a flair for creating memorable visual identities, impactful marketing material, and elegant user interfaces. My work has been praised for both its originality and clarity. I know my way around most wireframing and prototyping tools, but I also like to use good old pen and paper. My strong desire to understand how things work under the hood led me to web development. Over the years, I have worked with AngularJS, Ionic, MongoDB, Node.js, React, and Redux. I enjoy learning new frameworks and workflows, and during my spare time, I am usually reading some documentation.</p>
            <p>A day is too short to keep up with all my interests. I have played many competitive sports, including badminton, ping-pong, and chess — yes, chess is a sport. I also practiced taekwondo for many years. These days, I nourish a passion for motor racing and try to be on the track whenever possible.</p>
            <p>My mother tongue is French and I am proudly bilingual.</p>
