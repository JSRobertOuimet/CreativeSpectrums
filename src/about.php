            <p>My name is Jean-Simon Robert Ouimet, and I am a passionate visual designer with a strong inclination towards branding and front-end web development. I like to translate business requirements into seamless experiences informed by user research and brand recognition. I love to turn those experiences into elegant interfaces using the latest technologies. I enjoy both working independently or as part of a team where cooperation is the common denominator. My mother tongue is French and I’m proudly bilingual. I’m a former musician who persistently strives to create that pitch-perfect moment that will make a positive change for my audience.</p>
